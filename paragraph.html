    Fall is my favorite season because its when my birthday is and its moderately chilly weather greatly appeals to me. 
    <br>
    <br>

    Birthday is the most special day for me and celebrating it with my family while I’m all dressed in jackets or cozy sweatshirts and enjoying hot cocoa at a restaurant is delightful.
    <br>
    <br>
    Even more, I despise a super hot or super cold weather, but fall falls nearly in the middle, leaning a bit more towards the cold, but I like that.
    <br>
    <br>
    The most beautiful part of it is watching the vibrant leaves of orange, red, brown, and green surrounding you and showering on you or your car wherever you voyage. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I love wearing jackets, sweaters, boots, and beeanies that become the fashion when fall arrives. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I enjoy celebrating halloween with my younger siblings and friends too because we get to eat so many candies. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Fall also marks the start of the football season at my school, giving me and my friends the opportunity to watch the football game together out in the field.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fall’s chilly weather relieves people of the scorching hot weather of summer and offers a smooth transition into winter. 
    <br>
    <br>
    These are all the reasons why I enjoy fall.
